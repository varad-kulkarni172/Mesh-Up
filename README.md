Emergency Mesh Network
This project demonstrates a mesh network solution for disaster-affected areas where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable. The system leverages IoT devices (e.g., ESP8266), desktops, Raspberry Pi, and mobile devices to form an ad-hoc mesh network, enabling decentralized communication in emergency scenarios.

🚀 Features
Ad-hoc Mesh Networking: Devices form a decentralized network, automatically discovering and connecting with peers.
UDP-based Communication: Lightweight and efficient message exchange using UDP protocol.
Message Rebroadcasting: Ensures messages propagate through the network.
Device Interoperability: Supports platforms like ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, laptops, desktops, and Android devices.
Flood Protection: Prevents message duplication using unique IDs and a history log.
Message Acknowledgment: Ensures message reliability and traceability.
📜 Message Structure (UDP Header)
Messages transmitted over the UDP protocol include the following structure: [Message ID] | [Origin Device ID] | [Message Content]

Components:
Message ID: Unique identifier for each message, composed of the device’s DEVICE_ID and a random suffix (e.g., 123abc-5678).
Origin Device ID: The unique ID of the device that originated the message.
Message Content: The actual communication payload.
Example:
123abc-5678 | 123abc | Emergency at Location X

Key Benefits:
Uniqueness: Prevents message duplication.
Traceability: Identifies the source of the message.
Data Integrity: Ensures meaningful communication.
🛠️ Project Components
1. IoT Device Code (ESP8266)
Language: Arduino C++
Functionality:
Operates as a SoftAP (Hotspot) or connects to open Wi-Fi networks.
Sends and receives UDP messages using the specified header structure.
Rebroadcasts messages to ensure network-wide communication.
Tracks message history to prevent flooding.
2. MeshNetworkClient.java (Java Swing App)
Platform: Java Swing
Purpose: Provides a user-friendly interface for desktops, laptops, and Raspberry Pi.
Functionality:
Acts as a client node in the mesh network.
Allows manual message input and displays received messages.
Visualizes network activity and message propagation.
3. MainActivity.java (Android App)
Platform: Android
Purpose: Extends the mesh network's functionality to mobile devices.
Functionality:
Provides a mobile-friendly interface for sending and receiving messages.
Displays network activity in real-time.
Offers push notifications for incoming messages.
Integrates with Wi-Fi APIs for dynamic connection management.
🛴 Getting Started
1. Setting up the IoT Device (ESP8266)
Connect the ESP8266 to your computer.
Open the provided code (ESP8266_MeshNetwork.ino) in the Arduino IDE.
Configure the SSID and UDP_PORT if required.
Upload the code to the device.
Power the device and observe the serial monitor for network activity.
2. Using the Java Swing Client
Compile and run the MeshNetworkClient.java file.
Connect the device to the same Wi-Fi as the mesh network.
Start communicating via the GUI.
3. Using the Android App
Import the project into Android Studio.
Open MainActivity.java and ensure the necessary dependencies are installed.
Build and install the APK on your Android device.
Connect the mobile device to the mesh network Wi-Fi.
Start the app to send and receive messages.
🛡️ How It Works
Network Formation:

Each ESP device creates an open SoftAP network.
Devices scan for and connect to nearby open networks, forming a mesh.
Message Transmission:

Messages are tagged with unique IDs (DEVICE_ID + Random Suffix).
Sent messages are broadcasted over the mesh using UDP.
Message Handling:

Devices receiving messages check for duplication using the Message ID.
Non-duplicate messages are acknowledged and rebroadcasted.
Java Client:

Connects to the mesh network.
Allows users to view, send, and track messages in real-time.
Android App:

Acts as a portable node in the mesh.
Facilitates mobile-based interaction for disaster management.
🌟 Use Cases
Real-time communication during disaster recovery.
Ad-hoc networks for outdoor events or remote areas.
Educational demonstrations of decentralized communication systems.
